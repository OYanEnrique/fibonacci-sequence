# fibonacci-sequence
A simple command-line script written in Python that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number of terms.

# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This is a Python script that generates the Fibonacci sequence, a famous mathematical sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

The program prompts the user to specify how many terms of the sequence they want to see and then prints them sequentially to the console.

## Features

-   Generates the Fibonacci sequence starting from 0.
-   The length of the sequence is determined by user input.
-   Clean and simple output printed directly to the console.
-   A straightforward implementation ideal for learning purposes.

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system.
2.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `fibonacci_sequence.py`).
3.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
4.  Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
5.  Execute the script with the following command:
    ```bash
    python fibonacci_sequence.py
    ```
6.  The script will then ask you to input the number of terms you wish to see.

## Usage Example

If you run the script and enter `10` as the number of terms, the output will be:

```
Fibonacci Sequence
Number of terms:10

0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
End
```
